This is a log of things I did to link KiCad 9.0.x to the component database DB on Windows 11


Downloaded and installed sqliteodbc_w64.exe from http://www.ch-werner.de/sqliteodbc/
 * Note: Version installed is present in SETUP.zip

In KiCad, added environment variable "DANDB_DIR" with value "D:\Github\Danakil_KiCad_DB" using the Configure Paths GUI under Preferences.
 * Note: This is where the component database is located on my computer. You will likely need to use a different directory.

In KiCad, added all libraries in D:\Github\Danakil_KiCad_DB\Symbols to the KiCad installation as existing libraries using the Symbol Libraries GUI under Preferences 
 * Note: This is where the symbol libraries are located on my computer. This could also have been written as ${DANDB_DIR}\Symbols

In KiCad, added all libraries in D:\Github\Danakil_KiCad_DB\Footprints to the KiCad installation as existing libraries using the Footprint Libraries GUI under Preferences 
 * Note: This is where the footprint libraries are located on my computer. This could also have been written as ${DANDB_DIR}\Footprints

In KiCad's Footprint editor:
 * Pinned all the libraries in ${DANDB_DIR}\Footprints that we just added

In KiCad, added Danakil_KiCad_Database.kicad_dbl to the KiCad installation as an existing library using the Symbol Libraries GUI under Preferences 
 * Yielded an error

Opened ODBC Data Sources (64-bit)
 * Added SQLite3 OBDC Driver
 |  * Set Data Source Name to Danakil Database
 |  * Set Database Name to D:\Github\Danakil_KiCad_DB\Danakil_KiCad_database.sqlite
 |  |  * This is where the database is on my computer. Your location will likely be different.
 |  * All other parameters left at default values

In KiCad, removed and added back Danakil_KiCad_Database.kicad_dbl to the KiCad installation as an existing library using the Symbol Libraries GUI under Preferences 
 * Yielded the same error

Changed the connection string in Danakil_KiCad_Database.kicad_dbl to "DSN=Danakil Database"
In KiCad, removed and added back Danakil_KiCad_Database.kicad_dbl to the KiCad installation as an existing library using the Symbol Libraries GUI under Preferences 
 * Yielded no error???

Renamed the symbol libraries Passives.kicad_sym and Test Points.kicad_sym to 0Dan_Passives.kicad_sym and 0Dan_Test Points.kicad_sym respectively

Deleted symbol libraries named Passives and Test Points in KiCad using the Symbol Libraries GUI

Added 0Dan_Passives.kicad_sym and 0Dan_Test Points.kicad_sym to KiCad using the Symbol Libraries GUI
